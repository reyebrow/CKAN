This module is used on datadotgc.ca to connect with the CKAN API at ca.ckan.net.

It is based on the starter module for data.gov.uk - https://github.com/practicalweb/drupal-ckan by Sean Burlington.

Please note that this is specific to ca.ckan.net only and it's customizations.

To use it download Drupal and install it.

Then add the module as usual in sites/all/modules/ckan/

You will now have the ability to use your Drupal site to search for CKAN packages - and store comments etc about the packages in your site.
